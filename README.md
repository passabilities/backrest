## Package Module

This project uses [ExpressJS](http://expressjs.com/) behind the scenes. Please visit their website to have a better understanding of how routing and requests work.

### Routing

Creating routes are meant to be easy with a very simple structure.

Routes are defined in `config/routes.js`

Each route will need a couple things:

* An action verb
* URL end point
* Controller name
* Action name

The layout of each route will be in the following format:

* `'{verb} {url}': '{controller}#{action}'`
* **verb**
  * `get`, `post`, `put`, or `delete`
* **url**
  * URL end point that begins at root (leading `/` is optional)
  * URLs are allowed to have parameters defined denoted using a colon (`:`)
    * Example: `users/:id`
* **controller**
  * The controller name is the prefix of the file it is defined in. For example you would use `users` for the controller `app/controllers/users_controller.js`
* **action**
  * This is the name of the function to call defined in the controller.

There are a couple ways to define how routes work:

1. All inline:

  `'get users/all': 'users#getAll'`

1. Nested:

  ```javascript
    'users': {
      'get all': 'users#getAll'
    }
  ```

1. Exclude controller name:

  If the root of the URL is the same as the controller name, you may exclude it in the route definition. Both of the following point to the `users` controller:
  ```javascript
    'get users/all': 'getAll',
    'users': {
      'get all': 'getAll'
    }
  ```

### Controllers

Controllers are used to define the actions to take place on each request.

They should be saved to the `app/controllers/` directory with the suffix `_controller.js` attached. For example `app/controllers/users_controller.js`

#### Actions

Each action function will have 2 arguments. `req` and `res` standing for `request` and `response` respectfully.

```javascript
getAll(req, res) {

}
```

#### Before Filters

Each before filter function will have 3 arguments: `req`, `res`, and `next`

Before filters can do perform the following tasks:
  * Execute any code.
  * Make changes to the request and the response objects.
  * End the request-response cycle.
  * Call the next before filter or action function for the request.

##### Definition

Before filters are defined in the controller by returning an array of objects. Each object should contain at least 1 property called `action` which is the pointer to the function to be called. Other properties to be used are `only` OR `except` which tell the router which actions to call the before filters for. `only` and `except` can be either a string or array of strings denoting the name of the actions.

Defining the filters in an array like this allow for easy subclassing of the controllers without losing any functionality.

```javascript
get before() {
  return [
    { action: this._sayHello },
    { action: this._checkAdmin, except: ['getPublic'] }
  ]
}
```

Examples:

```javascript
_sayHello(req, res, next) {
  console.log('Hello!')
  next()
}

_checkAdmin(req, res, next) {
  let user = getUserById(req.params.id)
  if(user.isAdmin)
    next()
  else
    console.log('User is not admin. Action is prohibited.')
}
```
